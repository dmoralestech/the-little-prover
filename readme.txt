This repository contains all the code examples from "The Little Prover" book.
The Little Prover teaches the readers how to determine facts about recursive
functions using induction. The book starts with programming concepts such as
recursive functions and lists, and leads the reader along the shortest path
to inductive proofs.

If you're interested, get the book from Amazon: http://amzn.to/1I4JnqC

While working through this book, you'll need j-bob, the proof assistant:

The code examples were copied (and completed where necessary) from
"The Little Prover" by Peteris Krumins (peter@catonmat.net).
